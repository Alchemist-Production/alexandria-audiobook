“We have to turn back,” Mark said, adjusting his pack. “The storm is getting worse.”
“It’s just a little rain,” Chloe countered, though she shivered as the wind howled. She looked toward the ridge, her jaw set.
“It’s not just rain, it’s whiteout conditions,” Maya added quietly, checking the map. “Mark is right, Chloe. We’re losing visibility.”
Chloe finally looked away from the path. “Fine. But we are taking the shorter route down.”
“That route is too steep,” Mark protested.
“It’s faster,” Chloe snapped. “And I’m freezing.”
Maya sighed, looking between them. “We can take the, um, intermediate path? It’s a compromise.”
